# Overview
<br/>These files are for the UVM CMPE5990 - Machine Learning course's final project. To run the XGBoost_model.ipynb and even_more_regression.ipynb files make sure they are in the same folder as the imputed_temperature_columns_by_day_poly_lasso_cv.xlsx file. <br/>The XGBoost script trains an XGBoost model on the weather dataset and plots the results. 
<br/>The regression script contains multiple regression models trained on the dataset along with plotting of results.
